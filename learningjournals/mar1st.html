    <h3>Game Design Research</h3>
    <p>Game Design is already something I have some knowledge in through experience and observation. The concept of placing certain features in different areas to subconciously direct people towards making certain actions, or making certain associations, is a tactic I am well aware of. For instance, in my Every Image project, the items to be selected are on the left side of the screen, and the elements that change depending on selection are on the right. This is a trend that I have seen countless times as a way of sectioning off parts of a screen for different purposes, with several games making "margins" on the screen that are dedicated to important elements or information. I will absolutely be using these strategies in the Game On project.</p>
