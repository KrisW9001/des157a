        The concept of showcasing items on a shelf to protray a part of yourself is nothing new, but I plan to take it in a different direction and showcase my gaming collection. I wanted to have a concept where I could easily provide my own input on the subject and add personal flair to the items being showcased by allowing items on this virtual bookshelf to be "picked up" and examined. I want this project to show how much thought I put into my most significant hobby by giving brief descriptions of what I do and Don't like about each game.

    <p>
        I think this item is supposed to be a tape recorder of some sort? When I look at this image I immediately think of how the different elements of the device could be re-contextualized into an interactible webpage element. It's obvious this has something to do with audio or editing or something, but I still have absolutely no idea to what extent this is going to be relevant to Sky's larger project.
