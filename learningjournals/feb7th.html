        <p>Modals are something that I have never really thought of using, or known how to use. Using the prompt tag in VSC brings one up, I know that much, and aside from that my knowledge of these things are from my own experiences of using the internet. I don't see very many outside of social media, but I can understand the need to ensure that they don't interrupt the functions of a site too much. I personally think the best way to make use of Modals is to use them as infrequently as possible, usually resulting in not using them at all. They have a very specific niche to fill in the design of a site, so it doesn't make much sense to try and make excuses for new ways to use them.</p>
