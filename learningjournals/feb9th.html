    <p>After doing research on my selected website and taking a closer look at the Intriguing Photographs article, I can absolutely understand the point that is trying to be made. Being able to understand photos and how they are used with different purposes is crucial not only for designing for the web, but understanding how to interpret the feedback you get. A confusing image is not going to help anyone, but with careful consideration and the right amount of prompting the viewer, photos can evoke specific reactions based on what the photo is being used for. In the case of the Website I researched, the site advertises a brand of Kitchen Sink called Water (incredible name by the way, totally didn't confuse me the first time I was browsing the page) and uses a lot of imagery not only of the products in use, but of the various features that it has even without directly explaining them, because it doesn't have to. The site doesn't need a paragraph explaining why a vegetable rack is an additional feature of the product if they can just show how it works in a quick image, and then move on to the features that need explaining.</p>
