    <h1>Project Brief</h1>
    <p>I plan to update the Every Picture Project to more closely resemble the original intent for the project. This will likely include making a fixed resolution for the background, re-evaluating how to implement the images and how they are interacted with/respond to interaction, and implementing the original overlay concept once the preview system is refined.</p>
