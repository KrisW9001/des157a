    <p>My testers were Jennifer, Laura, and Sriram. My project was not in a very polished state, but the feedback I got was incredibly helpful. There were multiple issues that were consistent across the three tester's experiences, as well as a few common reccomendations.</p>

    <h2>Issues</h2>
        <h3>Non-functional interactive elements</h3>
            <p>The boxes in the image are supposed to be interactible, but were not fucntional in the user test. This was an issue, because all of the testers picked up on the fact that there was supposed to be more to it than just hovering over them to change the preview image. The overlay function will need to be implemented since it is very obvious that then intent is for the users to click on the objects in the image to do something.</p>
        <h3>header issues</h3>
            <p>Most of the testers thought that the header was supposed to be interactible, referring specifically to the gradient in the header and the rounded shape. Sriram suggested changing it to a full-page banner, which seems like the best option.</p>
        <h3>Text Colors and their Meanings</h3>
            <p>The preview text, which will become the overlay text, uses differently colored paragraph text to indicate my tone/opinion towards the game being selected. The testers did not pick up on this as intended, and consistently reported that the yellow text was hard to read. Using images or a different background will alleviate this issue.</p>
    
    <h2>Positives</h2>
        <h3>Item Tags</h3>
            <p>Jennifer found that when hovering over the different sections in the image map, a tag would appead that has the section's ID tag. They thought this was intentional, and this could be used as a beneficial feature of the interactive elements of the page.</p>
        <h3>Compliments on the concept</h3>
            <p>The testers complimented the concept of the project, saying that the idea of picking things off of a bookshelf was a novel concept to re-create through javascript. Some comprimises have to be made to make the coding actually possible, but the compliments were greatly appreciated.</p>
        <h3>The preview system</h3>
            <p>The testers understood the idea that hovering over a game would bring up a preview of the game to the side, and that in the final version clicking on it would bring up a more detailed overlay with information on it.The fact that the testers understood that the image to the side was supposed to be a preview rather than the main interactive component was good news for the sake of the progress towards the final version.</p>
